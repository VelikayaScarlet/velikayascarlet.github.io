<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master's student at the <a href="https://ccs.imu.edu.cn/">College of Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://www.mglip.com/">National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Information Processing Technology for Mongolian</a>, Inner Mongolia University. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Zhengzhou University of Light Industry in 2023.

My research interests include: <span style="font-weight: bold;">

(1) NLP & Society, including AI Fairness, Responsible AI, and Computational Social Science

(2) Multilingual & Multicultural AI, including Multilingual systems, Low-resource Languages

(3) Culture & Creativity in LLMs, including Literature and LLMs, and Subcultures in AI

# 🚁 Beyond Academics
I'm a Bilibili uploader (<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/23297003">Velikaya</a>), specializing in TNO-style superevent videos. I’m also passionate about language learning/constructing. 

In moments shaped by life’s struggles—for poetry thrives on hardship—I craft classical verses.
